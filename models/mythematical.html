    Concessions from Calhoun's description:
    <ul>
        <li>Calhoun does not define independent variables but implies them, for example "each enters a state...that lasts for <u>some time</u> after the encounter" (underline added).</li>
        <li>"Velocity" is constant in Calhoun's description, but not here. Movement here is instead random to one adjacent cell per step.</li>
        <li>It is not clear what "bent arrow" rerpesents in paragraph 1 for "Ball 'A'" in need state. Here need state does not affect the random movement.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
